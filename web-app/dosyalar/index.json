In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described Animal Farm as a satirical tale against Stalin (\"un conte satirique contre Staline\"),[4] and in his essay \"Why I Write\" (1946), wrote that Animal Farm was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, \"to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole\".","ustID":"4870f231-7425-4a13-bd50-f03a1bb275e5","id":"5b361410-46d6-4a44-8773-305336bce4bd","title":"animal farm"},{"expanded":true,"children":[],"icerik":"Nineteen Eighty-Four, often published as 1984, is a dystopian novel by English author George Orwell published in 1949.[1][2] The novel is set in Airstrip One (formerly known as Great Britain), a province of the superstate Oceania in a world of perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance and public manipulation, dictated by a political system euphemistically named English Socialism (or Ingsoc in the government's invented language, Newspeak) under the control of a privileged elite of the Inner Party, that persecutes individualism and independent thinking as \"thoughtcrime.\"[3]","ustID":"4870f231-7425-4a13-bd50-f03a1bb275e5","id":"e4469633-00de-419a-aad3-e460ac14e075","title":"1984"}],"icerik":"Eric Arthur Blair (25 June 1903 – 21 January 1950[1]), who used the pen name George Orwell, was an English novelist, essayist, journalist, and critic.

He is perhaps best known for his dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) and the allegorical novella Animal Farm (1945). His non-fiction works, including The Road to Wigan Pier (1937), documenting his experience of working class life in the north of England, and Homage to Catalonia (1938), an account of his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, are widely acclaimed, as are his essays on politics, literature, language, and culture. In 2008, The Times ranked him second on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".[4]\n\nOrwell's work continues to influence popular and political culture, and the term Orwellian—descriptive of totalitarian or authoritarian social practices—has entered the language together with many of his neologisms, including cold war, Big Brother, thought police, Room 101, memory hole, newspeak, doublethink, and thoughtcrime.[5]","ustID":"2b26c56d-05bd-488f-ba31-0dafd03fdf76","id":"4870f231-7425-4a13-bd50-f03a1bb275e5","title":"george orwell"},{"expanded":true,"children":[{"expanded":true,"children":[],"icerik":"The Metamorphosis (German: Die Verwandlung, also sometimes translated as The Transformation) is a novella by Franz Kafka, first published in 1915.
